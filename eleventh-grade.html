					<h2>11th Grade - AP Computer Programming 2</h2>
					<p>The AP Computer Programming 2 course is equivalent to a first-semester, college-level course in computer science. The course introduces students to computer science with fundamental topics that include problem solving, design strategies and methodologies, organization of data (data structures), approaches to processing data (algorithms), analysis of potential solutions, and the ethical and social implications of computing. The course emphasizes object-oriented and imperative problem solving and design using the Java language. These techniques represent proven approaches for developing solutions that can scale up from small, simple problems to large, complex problems. The AP Computer Programming 2 course curriculum is compatible with many CS1 courses in colleges and universities.</p>

					<h3 class="major">Quarter 1: Outbreak</h3>
					<p><b>Description: </b>Prompts the user for the number of rows and the number of columns of desks within a classroom. The program will then ask the user for a decimal probability (0 – 1) of how many students will be sick that day. Use a matrix to keep track of which students are sick and which are healthy. Once this has been determined, display the results out to the screen along with the probability (formatted to two decimals).</p>

							<p>The Outbreak program running with 5 rows, 5 columns, and a .4 probability.</p>
						</article>
						<article style="background-color:#2e3141;">
							<p><b>Process: </b>The assignment was worked on individually for approximately four days.</p>
							<p><b>Skills Gained and Applied: </b>Extensive knowledge of matrices and generating random numbers were used in this project.</p>
							<p><b>Reflection: </b>This project required the usage of several concepts and served as a good test of my ability. Several for loops were used in its making, along with a number of if loops. Arrays and matrices also played a major part in this project. The matrices used in this project can very well be used for other suitable situations in the future.</p>

					<h3 class="major">Career Research Entry: Computer Programmer</h3>
					<p><b>Description: </b>Computer programmers write the code that allows software programs to run. So just like a boss tells an employee what to do, a programmer tells a computer what to do. Basically, they write directions in C++ and Python or another language, and the computer then follows the programmer's detailed instructions. In many cases, a programmer's work will start after a software developer or engineer passes off design specifications for a particular program. The programmer's job entails refining the ideas and solving the problems that arise while converting the program into code. Programmers can also rewrite, debug, maintain and test (and retest and retest) software and programs that instruct the computer to accomplish certain tasks, such as storing or retrieving data, so the computer can perform better and more efficiently.</p>
					<p><b>Areas of Specialization: </b>Write programs in a variety of computer languages, such as C++ and Java Updating and expanding existing programs Debugging programs by testing for and fixing errors Building and using computer-assisted software engineering (CASE) tools to automate the writing of some code Using code libraries, which are collections of independent lines of code, to simplify the writing</p>
					<p><b>Expected Salary Ranges </b>The BLS reports the median annual wage for computer programmers was $76,140 in 2013. The best-paid 10 percent in the field made approximately $123,490, while the bottom 10 percent made approximately $43,640.</p>
					<p><b>Education/Certifications Required: </b>Most computer programmers have a bachelor’s degree; however, some employers hire workers who have an associate’s degree. Most programmers get a degree in computer science or a related subject.</p>
					<p>Programmers can become certified in specific programming languages or for vendor-specific programming products. Some companies may require their computer programmers to be certified in the products they use.</p>
					<p><b>Job Prospects: </b>Between 2012 and 2022, the Bureau of Labor Statistics projects employment for the industry, which already boasts more than 300,000 professionals, to grow 8.3 percent.</p>
					<p><b>Job Setting: </b>Programming is highly detailed work, and it usually involves fluency in several languages. Projects can be short and require only a few days of coding, or they can be very long, involving upward of a year to write. And because a large amount of a programmer's time will be spent alone in front of a computer, telecommuting is a perk many programmers take advantage of. The job can be stressful at times, but with a median salary of $76,140 in 2013, computer programmers are compensated well for any anxiety they might experience.</p>
					<p><b>Companies or Organizations: </b>Google Inc., a technology company, provides various services for people and businesses. The company provides its products and services in approximately 100 languages and in approximately 50 countries, regions, and territories. The company primarily delivers online advertising that consumers find relevant and that advertisers find cost-effective. Its advertising solutions help various companies improve their businesses. The company offers a range of products across screens and devices. It primarily delivers both performance advertising and brand advertising.</p>

						<article style="background-color:#2e3141;">
							<p><b>Process: </b>The assignment was worked on in groups for approximately three weeks.</p>
							<p><b>Skills Gained and Applied: </b>Nearly everything we learned up to this point was used. This most notably includes enumerated data types, class composition, and constructors/methods.</p>
							<p><b>Reflection: </b>This project provided great insight into how projects in the real world are worked on. Instead of working individually like I had been for the time prior to this, I had to find ways to work together with my group to complete the program. It also reinforced the design process involved with large scale projects, which we mirrored by initially planning everything out, which was then followed by coding and finally debugging. </p>

					<h3 class="major">Career Research Entry: Software Developer</h3>
					<p><b>Description: </b>Software developers invent the technologies that you take for granted every day. They could spend their days working on a client project from scratch and writing new code. But they could also be tasked with maintaining or improving the code for programs that are already up and running. Software developers also check for bugs in software. Developers are often natural problem solvers who possess strong analytical skills and the ability to think outside the box.</p>
					<p><b>Areas of Specialization: </b>There are two categories of specialization: speciailization in a particular programming field and specialization in a problem domain. Examples of a programming topic include embedded, GUI, visualization, and testing. Examples of particular problem domains include financial, scientific, and medical.</p>
					<p><b>Expected Salary Ranges </b>The Labor Department reports that software developers made a median salary of $92,660 in 2013. The highest-paid 10 percent in the profession earned $143,540 in 2013, while the lowest-paid earned $55,770.</p>
					<p><b>Education/Certifications Required: </b>A bachelor's degree in computer science is a good idea, but a degree alone won't help you snag that dream job.
						<blockquote>“We look at track records as much as school – someone from a great school with no outside coding projects or interesting technical accomplishments is definitely less interesting, and someone who is a rock star coder with no degree but a huge list of achievements would be an easy hire"</blockquote>
					</p>
					<p><b>Job Prospects: </b>The Bureau of Labor Statistics projects a whopping 22.8 percent employment growth for software developers between 2012 and 2022, which is much faster than average for all occupations. In that period, an estimated 139,900 jobs will open up.</p>
					<p><b>Job Setting: </b>Software developers sit at their desks designing programs all day. Although the job does involve extreme concentration and chunks of uninterrupted time, software developers have to collaborate with others, including fellow developers, management or clients.</p>
					<p><b>Companies or Organizations: </b>Amazon.com, Inc. is an American electronic commerce and cloud computing company with headquarters in Seattle, Washington. It is the largest Internet-based retailer in the United States. Amazon.com started as an online bookstore, later diversifying to sell DVDs, Blu-rays, CDs, video downloads/streaming, MP3 downloads/streaming, audiobook downloads/streaming, software, video games, electronics, apparel, furniture, food, toys and jewelry. The company also produces consumer electronics—notably, Amazon Kindle e-book readers, Fire tablets, Fire TV and Fire Phone—and is the world's largest provider of cloud infrastructure services (IaaS). Amazon also sells certain low-end products like USB cables under its in-house brand AmazonBasics.</p>
					<p>Microsoft Corporation is an American multinational technology company headquartered in Redmond, Washington, that develops, manufactures, licenses, supports and sells computer software, consumer electronics and personal computers and services. Its best known software products are the Microsoft Windows line of operating systems, Microsoft Office office suite, and Internet Explorer and Edge web browsers.

					<h3 class="major">Quarter 3: Stopwatch</h3>
					<p><b>Description: </b>In a Graphical User Interface (GUI) application, design a stopwatch that can be used to keep track of elapsed time. Include two buttons, one to start the timer and another to stop the timer, as well as text displaying the elapsed time in seconds formatted to one decimal place. If the user starts again, reset the elapsed time to 0.0 seconds; do not pick off from the previous timing.</p>

						</article>
						<article style="background-color:#2e3141;">
							<p><b>Process: </b>The assignment was worked on individually for approximately two days.</p>
							<p><b>Skills Gained and Applied: </b>Graphical User Interfaces were, for sure, the main focus of this project. After learning about JLabels and the ActionListener interface, I was able to successfully implement the two together. Other previously learned object-orienting (OOP) concepts were also used in its making.</p>
							<p><b>Reflection: </b>This project allowed me to branch out from merely relying on material learned in class. After being introduced to the Java API, I was forced to search through the various methods available. In this case, I made use of the System class, which consequently introduced me to the Long data type, a data type used to integer numbers that are too large to fit in the Integer data type. The Graphical User Interface used to create the project itself was also a nice change from the typical console-only output and is far more applicable to real-world applications.</p>

					<h3 class="major">Career Research Entry: Web Developer</h3>
					<p><b>Description: </b>Web developers are responsible for creating webistes. The job includes meeting with clients and asking broad questions like, "What do you want your site to accomplish?" and more detailed questions like, "What features do you want your site to have?" After ascertaining a client's desires, Web designers will start designing. This involves a multi-step process, which includes innovating a new design, writing the code, adding animation (if needed), checking for bugs and fixing them, presenting the client with a test site and moving the site to the client's server.</p>
					<p><b>Areas of Specialization: </b>Many Web development companies will split the responsibilities to design a website's front and back end. For instance, some Web developers will work in Photoshop to create the overall design, while others will be in charge of writing the code in programming languages such as HTML and CSS.</p>
					<p><b>Expected Salary Ranges </b>The BLS reports that Web developers made a median salary of $63,490 in 2014. The highest-paid in the profession earned $112,680, while the lowest-paid earned $33,790 that year. Computer systems design and information services employ the largest share of Web developers in the field. The highest-paid positions can be found in the metropolitan areas of San Jose, California; San Francisco; and Seattle.</p>
					<p><b>Education/Certifications Required: </b>
						<blockquote>Many employers prefer prospective Web developers to hold a bachelor's degree in computer science or a related field. Coursework often includes programming, database management, mathematics, Web design and networking. Work experience accompanied by a professional certification may be an adequate substitute for formal education in some cases.</blockquote>
					</p>
					<p><b>Job Prospects: </b>The Bureau of Labor Statistics projects about 27 percent employment growth for Web developers by 2024. During that period, about 39,500 new jobs will need to be filled in an industry that already has roughly 148,500 positions. The expansion of e-commerce is expected to be the main driver of Web developer job growth in the next decade. As more companies offer or expand their online retail presence, more Web developers will be needed to build the websites visited by consumers to purchase their favorite products. Increased reliance on mobile search is another reason the industry’s employment growth should remain strong.</p>
					<p><b>Job Setting: </b>Work environments for Web developers vary from large corporations or governments to small businesses. Developers may be full-time employees, part-time consultants or work on a contract basis as freelancers.</p>
					<p><b>Companies or Organizations: </b>Big Drop Inc. is a web design company based in New York City. They focus their services on four areas – design, branding, marketing and animated videos. This helps them to adapt unique and creative online experiences for their clients.</p>
					<p>Blue Fountain Media is a digital marketing agency from New York City providing website development and online marketing strategies.</p>

							<p>The DJ Emporium program running with the file data.txt open in the "Inventory" tab.</p>
						</article>
						<article style="background-color:#2e3141;">
							<p><b>Process: </b>The assignment was worked on individually for approximately three weeks.</p>
							<p><b>Skills Gained and Applied: </b>Though this project involved intensive use of graphical user intefaces, implenting the KeyListeners were equally, if not more, challenging. Besides GUIs, reading both in and out from a file were also heavily used.</p>
							<p><b>Reflection: </b>Though I have previously worked with graphical user interfaces and implemented store functionalities, it was ultimately DJ Emporium that joined the two together. After the fact, I can say with the utmost confidence that this was the most memorable project of the year. DJ Emporium was, in fact, what I felt to be the one project of the year that allowed me to make use of my programming skills for a functional program.</p>

					<h3 class="major">Career Research Entry: Database Administrator</h3>
					<p><b>Description: </b>With information so readily available in this era of apps, tablets and social media, data has become the new treasure organizations must protect and cherish. More than anyone else, database administrators are relied on as the guardians of this treasure, implementing security measures to ensure sensitive data doesn’t fall into the hands of unruly pirates while also managing the databases that help store and organize it.</p>
					<p><b>Areas of Specialization: </b>Database administrators – DBAs, for short – set up databases according to a company’s needs and make sure they operate efficiently. They will also fine-tune, upgrade and test modifications to the databases as needed. </p>
					<p><b>Expected Salary Ranges </b>The Labor Department reports that database administrators made a median salary of $80,280 in 2014. The highest-paid 10 percent in the profession earned $123,780, while the lowest-paid earned $44,470 that year. The top-paying metropolitan areas for this position are located in San Francisco; San Jose, California; and Boulder, Colorado.</p>
					<p><b>Education/Certifications Required: </b>
						<blockquote>Employers generally require a bachelor’s degree in a computer-related field, such as computer science or management information systems, although some favor applicants with a master’s degree in business administration with a concentration in information systems. Database administrators are often certified for a specific database platform, such as MySQL Database Administrator, Oracle DBA and Microsoft Certified Database Administrator.</blockquote>
					</p>
					<p><b>Job Prospects: </b>The Bureau of Labor Statistics projects 11 percent employment growth for database administrators by 2024. This outlook is promising, but tempered significantly from the large growth projection for the industry just a few years ago. Still, the strong growth estimate means that 13,400 new jobs will need to be filled by 2024.</p>
					<p><b>Job Setting: </b>The job involves resolving complex issues, so attention to detail is an essential trait in this profession, as is a passion for problem-solving. Communication skills are also important since DBAs often work as part of a team with computer programmers and managers. Ongoing maintenance of a database requires being on call, and a fifth of DBAs work more than 40 hours a week. These professionals are employed in a wide range of settings in the public and private sectors, and some DBAs work as consultants to organizations.</p>
					<p><b>Companies or Organizations: </b>Oracle Corporation is an American multinational computer technology corporation, headquartered in Redwood City, California. The company primarily specializes in developing and marketing database software and technology, cloud engineered systems and enterprise software products—particularly its own brands of database management systems.</p>
					<p>Dell Inc. is an American privately owned multinational computer technology company based in Round Rock, Texas, United States, that develops, sells, repairs, and supports computers and related products and services.</p>
